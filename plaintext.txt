Painting a roller coaster: So in my junior year of high school
I got a project to make a roller coaster for my physics class. 
Everything was going fine until the day my partner and I had to paint the thing. 
We were in my garage spray painting the tubes and these two guys come marching up 
to the house across the street and start yelling at the top of their lungs, 
beating on the door. Now let me say in my defense the neighborhood I lived in 
was in south Dallas and it s still not a safe place. Well I called the police, 
closed the garage and parked myself in front of the dining room window. 
Long story short the police showed up in full gear broke down the door and 
brought out the two boys at gunpoint.
And that s the story of how my entire block found out that the abandoned house had new owners.
